# webshop
A webshop poject i made for my 3rd semester. This project includes a back and front end.

The front end has been created in Vue with vuetify and axios.
Axis was used to call the back end rest api.
The backend has been created with Jersey and java 11.
Hibernate was also used in the backend for interacting with the database.

In this repo you can also find all documentation in the "pdfs" folder.
